I am a freelance software architect specialized in the development of web-based business applications on top of Microsoft's technology stack.
Born and raised in :belgium: but now I'm living a nomadic existence. 

For the last five years, I've worked with @dimenics on a product called [Dime.Scheduler](https://www.dimenics.com/products/dime-scheduler/), which is a horizontal add-in for ERP systems such as Dynamics 365 Business Central 🖥️.

I occassionally write a post on my [blog](https://hendrikbulens.com) ✍️.
